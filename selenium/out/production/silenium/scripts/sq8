Difference between get() and navigate()

 get() method:
After opening the browser, to open any particular application we use driver.get()

driver.get(“URL of the application”);


navigate() method:

This is another method which can be used to open the application.

driver.navigate().to(“URL of application”);

The difference is that if we use navigate(), it allows you to go forth and back into history of the browser,
refresh the browser etc. It is not possible if using get() method.


driver.navigate().back(); // Perform backward function of browser
driver.navigate().forward();  // Perform forward function of browser
driver.navigate().refresh(); //refresh the browser
