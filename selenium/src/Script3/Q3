There are number of benefits but from Selenium perspective, major advantages of TestNG are :

Annotations made testers life easy
Test cases can be Grouped & Prioritized more easily
Generates Logs
Data Parameterization is possible


Benefits of using Annotations are:

It identifies the methods it is interested in by looking up annotations. Hence method names are not restricted to any

We can pass additional parameters to annotations.
Annotations are strongly typed, so the compiler will flag any mistakes right away.
Test classes no longer need to extend anything (such as Test Case, for JUnit 3).
