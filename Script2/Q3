Implicit Wait - It instructs the web driver to wait for some time by poll the DOM. Once you declared implicit wait it
will be available for the entire life of web driver instance. By default the value will be 0. If you set a longer
default, then the behavior will poll the DOM on a periodic basis depending on the browser/driver implementation.

Explicit Wait + ExpectedConditions - Explicit waits are intelligent waits that are confined to a particular web element.
It will be used if we want the execution to wait for some time until some condition achieved.
